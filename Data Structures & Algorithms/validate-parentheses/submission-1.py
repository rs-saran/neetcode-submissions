# You are given a string s consisting of the following characters: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'.

# The input string s is valid if and only if:

# Every open bracket is closed by the same type of close bracket.
# Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
# Return true if s is a valid string, and false otherwise.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "[]"

# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "([{}])"

# Output: true
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "[(])"

# Output: false
# Explanation: The brackets are not closed in the correct order.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
