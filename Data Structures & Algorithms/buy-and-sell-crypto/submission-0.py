# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.

# You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.

# Return the maximum profit you can achieve. You may choose to not make any transactions, in which case the profit would be 0.

# Example 1:

# Input: prices = [10,1,5,6,7,1]

# Output: 6
# Explanation: Buy prices[1] and sell prices[4], profit = 7 - 1 = 6.

# Example 2:

# Input: prices = [10,8,7,5,2]

# Output: 0
# Explanation: No profitable transactions can be made, thus the max profit is 0.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= prices.length <= 100
# 0 <= prices[i] <= 100

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        for p in prices:
            max_profit = max(max_profit, p-min_so_far)
            min_so_far = min(min_so_far,p)
