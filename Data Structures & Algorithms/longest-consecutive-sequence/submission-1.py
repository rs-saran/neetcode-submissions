# Longest Consecutive Sequence
# Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

# A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. 
# The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]

# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [2, 3, 4, 5].

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,3,2,5,4,6,1,1]

# Output: 7

# Constraints:

# 0 <= nums.length <= 1000
# -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        nums = set(nums) #O(n)

        max_seq_len  = 0

        for i in nums:

            seq_len = 1
            while True:
                if i+1 in nums:
                    seq_len+=1
                    i +=1
                else:
                    break
            max_seq_len = max(max_seq_len,seq_len)
        
        return max_seq_len
