# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

# Note: Alphanumeric characters consist of letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9).

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

# Output: true
# Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "tab a cat"

# Output: false
# Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s is made up of only printable ASCII characters.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = s.lower()
        s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum())

        l = len(s)

        lp = 0
        rp = l-1

        while lp<rp:
            if s[lp] != s[rp]:
                return False
            lp+=1
            rp-=1
        
        return True
